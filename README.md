## 🔬 Usage (Plotting Note)

to graph the control charts of a process and based on it deciding whether the system is in/out of control

### 3. Interpreting the Output

The system generates two key outputs:

1.  **Control Chart Visualisations:** High-quality PNG files generated by **ScottPlot**, displaying the UCL, LCL, Center Line (CL), and the plotted data points.
2.  **Supported Data :** : X-Bar charts with R(Range) or S(standard deviation) in form of json files as -> inputRX.json / inputRS.json
the graphed charts will be inside the same folder containing executable binaries (till now)
